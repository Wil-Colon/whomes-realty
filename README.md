MERN real-estate site. Allows creation/editing/deletion of listings.

# Project Description:
Application consists of a simple two page front end application consisting of a landing page and a listings page. The listing page will allow a user to view listings of homes and filter by price, rooms etc. The home page holds a contact form allowing users to send inquiry messages to the receiving Admin Messages pane.  Admin Panel created with login and user verification to allow an admin to create, edit and delete listings. 

# Built using:
-Typescript
-Node/Express
-Mongoose
-Firebase
-Mantine
-Context API

# Why was application created?
The application was built purely for learning purposes. The application was the first I've written using Typescript and was used as a learning playground.
I also wanted to learn:
-Simple quering of a mongoose database per a users interactions on the front end, then presenting the retrieved data with pagination.
-Futher my learning of firebase image storage. Adding and deleting items from storage.
-Mantine understaning.
-Further experience with using context API for state management. 
-Form experience, validating inputs, understanding dirty/touched input fields.
-I wanted to create a simple messages pane in the admin panel similar to recieving emails. Allowing an Admin to set messages as read or unread.
